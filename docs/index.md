## Example Conversation

```
You: What's on my Engineering board?

AI: I found 12 open cards on your Engineering board:

In Progress:
- #234 "Implement user authentication" (assigned to you)
- #235 "API rate limiting"

Needs Triage:
- #240 "Database migration script"
- #241 "Update dependencies"
...

You: Create a card for adding dark mode support

AI: Created card #242 "Add dark mode support" on the Engineering board.
    Would you like me to add any tags or assign it to someone?
```
