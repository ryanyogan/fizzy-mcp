```

## Manual Configuration

### Config File Location

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

### Configuration

Add Fizzy to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fizzy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fizzy-do-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIZZY_TOKEN": "your-fizzy-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Environment Variables

If you prefer to keep your token in environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fizzy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fizzy-do-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then add to your shell profile:

```bash
export FIZZY_TOKEN="your-fizzy-api-token"
```

## Using the Hosted Proxy

For environments where npx isn't available, use the hosted proxy:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fizzy": {
      "url": "https://fizzy.yogan.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Fizzy-Token": "your-fizzy-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Restart Required

After saving your config, fully quit and restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

## Verify It Works

Open Claude Desktop and try:

```
What Fizzy boards do I have access to?
```

You should see a list of your Fizzy boards.

## Troubleshooting

### "Tool fizzy_list_boards not found"

Claude Desktop may need a full restart. Quit completely (check system tray/menu bar) and reopen.

### Config file doesn't exist

Create the file and parent directories if they don't exist:

```bash
# macOS
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude
touch ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
